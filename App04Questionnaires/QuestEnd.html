<!-- ANUJA: You might just need to go over the amounts above please, to make sure they:
        1. Correspond to the correct variable from the Python code.
        2. Correctly reflect the payment, depending on whether it's in ECU or in pounds (£).
     ALSO, the "xx" of the participant code needs to be replaced by the real variable.
     AND, I unfortunately don't know what the "here" link is supposed to lead to. We can ask Michelle the question.
