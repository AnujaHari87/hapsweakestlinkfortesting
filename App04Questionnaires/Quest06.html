        <p>Helping you costs the stranger about <strong>40 U.S. dollars</strong> in total. However, the stranger says he or she does not want any money from you. You have six presents with you. The cheapest present costs <strong>10 U.S. dollars</strong>, the most expensive one costs <strong>60 U.S. dollars</strong>. Do you give one of the presents to the stranger as a “thank you” gift?</p>
        <p>Which present do you give?</p>
