    The video meeting is now terminated. <br/>
    We will now proceed to Part 2. <br/>

     <b>Note: </b>
    As this is a group experiment, and groups proceed at the pace of the slowest group member, on the following pages we have <b>on-screen timers</b> on the top of the pages.
    <br/><br/>If you <b> don't proceed to the next page or reach a decision in due time</b>, you will be tagged as a dropout and not paid for this study.
    <br/><br/>On <b>instructions</b> pages, the on-screen timers are <b><u>five minutes</u></b> and on decision pages, the on-screen timers are <b><u>three minutes</u></b>.
