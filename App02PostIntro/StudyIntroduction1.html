This part consists of 5 rounds. 
<br/><br/>
Imagine that you and the other two members of your group belong to a <b>virtual team </b>of a firm. You can think of a round as being a workweek. In each week, each of the virtual team members spends <b>40 hours </b>working for the firm. You must choose how to allocate your time between two projects, <b>Project A</b> and <b>Project B</b>.
<br/><br/>
Project B: Think of this project as your <b>own</b> project. It has been assigned to you by the firm and you are solely responsible for the success.
<br/><br/>
    Project A: This project is a <b>team</b> project. The success of this project depends on all members in your virtual team and is calculated by the contribution of the team member who contributes the least.
<br/><br/>
<b>We will ask you how many hours per round you allocate to Project A (denoted by h<sub>A</sub>).</b>
<br/><br/>
The available choices are <b>0 hours, 10 hours, 20 hours, 30 hours, and 40 hours</b>. Your remaining hours will be put towards Project B. For example, if you devote 30 hours to Project A, this means that 10 hours will be put towards Project B.
<br/><br/>
For your decision you have to consider the following conditions:<br/><br/> Working on the team Project A generates a higher effort for you than on your own Project B, i.e., <b>working on Project A generates additional costs of 5 ECU per hour </b> for you which will be deducted from your personal payoff in the respective round. <br/><br/>Note further, that we will also ask the other two members of your virtual team how they allocate their time to your common Project A and their own individual Project B. <br/> <br/>
