    <div class="my-box"> Playing a round: <br/><br/>

    In each round, you decide how many hours you allocate to Project A. The other three virtual team members will make the same decision. Note that the payoff structure is the same for all of you â€“ but not the amount. Note that, when making your decision, you will not know how the other team members decide in this round. We will not reveal the choices of individual team members. At the end of each round, we will inform you about your payoff and the lowest number of hours allocated to Project A by any of your team members. We will also show you all your past payoffs from previous rounds.
    <br/><br/>
    Payment: At the end of the 5 rounds, the computer will randomly select one round. This round will determine the payment you will receive from Part 2 of this study.  <br/><br/>
