     <b>Note: </b>
    As this is a team experiment, and teams proceed at the pace of the slowest team member, on the following pages we have <b>on-screen timers</b> on the top of the pages (see above).
    <br/><br/>
    If you <b> do not proceed to the next page or reach a decision within the given time</b>, you will be tagged as a dropout and not paid for this study.
    <br/><br/>
    On <b>instructions pages</b>, the on-screen timers are <b><u>five minutes</u></b> and on decision pages, the on-screen timers are <b><u>three minutes</u></b>.
