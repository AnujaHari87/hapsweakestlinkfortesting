    In this study, you will form a group with <b>three</b> other participants. All participants have been recruited over the Prolific platform. <br/>The study consists of <b>two</b> parts and a short survey. The participants you are grouped with will be the same in all parts of this study. <br/><br/>In <b>Part 1</b>, you will have the opportunity to meet with the other members of your group in a virtual meeting. This meeting will last 8 minutes. After Part 1 is finished, we will give you information about Part 2.


 <br/> <br/>
     <b>Note: </b>
    As this is a group experiment, and groups proceed at the pace of the slowest group member, on the following pages we have <b>on-screen timers</b> on the top of the pages.
    <br/><br/>If you <b> don't proceed to the next page or reach a decision in due time</b>, you will be tagged as a dropout and not paid for this study. On <b>instructions</b> pages, the on-screen timers are <b><u>five minutes</u></b> and on decision pages, the on-screen timers are <b><u>three minutes</u></b>.
