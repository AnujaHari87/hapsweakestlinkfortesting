                 You contributed <strong>{{ player.ownDecision }} hours</strong> to Project A.

                In this round, the minimum number of hours allocated to Project A in your team was <strong>{{ group.groupMin }} hours</strong>.

                Thus, your payoff in this round is <strong>{{ player.payoff_hypo }}</strong> ECU.

             is there an else part needed to this?-->
