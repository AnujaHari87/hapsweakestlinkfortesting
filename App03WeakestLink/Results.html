                 You contributed <strong>{{ player.ownDecision }} hours</strong> to Project A.
                <br/><br/>
                In this round, the minimum number of hours allocated to Project A in your team was <strong>{{  player.groupMin }} hours</strong>.
                <br><br>
                Thus, your payoff in this round is <strong>{{ player.payoff_hypo }}</strong> ECU.

             is there an else part needed to this?-->
