    In this study, we will be investigating how people make decisions in different situations.
    <br/>
    The study consists of <b>three stages and a questionnaire and will take about 45 minutes.</b>
    <br/> <br/>
    In this study, you will form a <b>team with two other participants. Your team will remain the same throughout the study. </b> This means that your team will always consist of the same members.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>In Stage 1</b>, you will be asked to answer various questions and to carry out technical tests in order to <b>check whether you can proceed with the study</b>. Therefore, within Stage 1, <b>you might not be able to proceed with the study and will have to return your submission</b>.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>In Stage 2</b>, you will get to know your team members in a <b>virtual team meeting</b>. You will have 7 minutes to get to know each other and exchange ideas.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>In Stage 3</b>, you will receive detailed information about the <b>task and the payoff</b> from this stage onwards. As part of this task, you will form a team again with your team members from Stage 2.
