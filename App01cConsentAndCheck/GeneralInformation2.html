    We use the currency "Experimental Currency Unit (ECU)" for the study. It will be converted into <b>GBP (£)</b> for payoff at the end of the study. <b> In this study, 10 ECU = £0.20.</b>
    <br/> <br/>
    <b>The payoff scheme is as follows: </b><br/><br/>
    <ul>
        <li>If you are not able to proceed with the study during Stage 1, you will not get any payoff and need to return your submission.
            <br/><br/></li>
        <li>If you will drop out of the study because we are not able to match you with a team, you will receive a <b>fixed payment of £1.50 </b>to compensate for your time efforts.  <br/><br></li>

     <li>If you will drop out of the study because one of your team members could not hear or see everyone, you will be exited from the study and receive a <b>fixed payment of £3.00</b>.<br></li>
    
	<br/>
        <li>If you complete the whole study,  you will receive a <b>fixed payment of £6.00 </b>for your participation.<br/><br/></li>
        <li>You may also receive an <b> additional bonus payment </b> in Stage 3. You will receive more detailed information about this before the start of Stage 3.<br/></li>
    </ul>
    Note: None of the participants will know how much another participant has been paid.
