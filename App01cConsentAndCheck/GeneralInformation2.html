    We use "Experimental Currency Unit (ECU)" for the study. It will be converted into <b>GBP (£)</b> for payoff at the end of the study. <b> <br/> In this study, 10 ECU = £0.20.</b>
    <br/> <br/>
    If you are not able to proceed with the study during Stage 1, you will not get any payoff and need to return your submission.
    <br/><br/>
    You will receive a <b>fixed payment of £6.00 for your participation in the study</b>.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>You may also receive an additional bonus payment in Stage 3. You will receive more detailed information before the start of Stage 3.</b>
    <br/><br/>
    Note: None of the participants will know how much another participant has been paid.
