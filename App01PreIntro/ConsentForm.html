Additionally, you are between 18 and 65 years old, speak English fluently, have at least 100 previous submissions, and have an approval rate of at least 95%. Furthermore, your residence is in the US and you have not participated in this study before.</p>

    <h4><b>Risk and benefits:</b></h4>

In addition to consenting to participate in the study, you will have the opportunity to opt-in to the use of your video and audio data in research presentations with a scientific audience. If you opt-in, your audio and video data will be kept by the researchers for an unlimited period of time, otherwise, it will be deleted ten years after completion of the study. Upon request, personal data (e.g., video, audio) will be made available to journal editors and reviewers to verify our statements.</p>
